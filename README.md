## Editing the file ðŸ¤©

It contains a file that predicts crime in your proximity using K-nn  and
another suvmission contains a simple markdown file in repository! ðŸ˜‹

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first_ipynb_upload contains a dataset from UK police department.
Containing 'crime type', 'location', 'crime ID' and similar details.
The task is to find the possibility of a new crime happening in your nearest.
Therefore we're using K-nearest neighbor to predict the same by using crime_type & location!

And the second ipynb file contains a simplest Jupyter notebook markdown file. 
And that's all.
Have a great day ahead!!
